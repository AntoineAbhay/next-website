      "excerpt": "HireSweet's mission is to solve the problem of recruitment in the tech industry. We've been developing tools to help recruiters find the right candidates to fill their open positions.\n\nI joined the team at the end of my studies in engineering school. Since then I had the opportunity to work on many different projects.\n\nWe've developed a validation library for Python and Javascript where schemas are defined in JSON. As JSON schema was still a draft, we decided to develop our own.\nI worked on internal tools to boost the operation team productivity. One of the job was to manually validate wether or not a candidate was a good enough fit for a given position. The goal was to have unperceptible latency between two profiles. We managed to do so mainly by prefetching the data just in time.\nAs emails are the main way to contact candidates, it was necessary to have integrations with both Gmail and Outlook as they cover a majority of companies. Automation is also a key factor to help recruiters. That's why we built contact sequences that can be triggered automatically, sending emails, followups, reminders etc.\nJust to name a few other projects:\n - Tracking email open and click events\n - Resume file creation using a lambda function and puppeteer\n - Calendly integration using webhooks to receive appointments notifications\n - Many application tracking systems integrations.",

      "excerpt": "Ayuda was a canadian company in the Out-of-Home (OOH) advertising industry with offices in Montreal, Berlin and Sydney. They were developing a software for static and digital advertising panels management.\n\nI worked there for 5 months in their Sydney downtown offices. I was mainly involved in the maintenance of the platform and client integration tasks such as customization of contracts and invoices. Working from Sydney was not ideal from a newcomer and technical perspective. The team there was divided in two offices and the most experienced developers of the company were at the other end of the planet. People at Ayuda were great though and I enjoyed working with them despite the difficulties.\n\nAyuda's stack was based on Microsoft SQL Server, C# and jQuery. It was my first experience with C# which is quite different from what I knew (Python and Javascript). I had to deal with types, object oriented programming and the .NET ecosystem. Honestly, I didn't like it much... maybe because I was not properly introduced and lacked time to ramp up my skills. I remember my fisrt task was about fixing an inexact value in a client's report. It implied debugging a thousand lines of sql stored procedure which was used in the generation of the report. I thought I had found the problem. My PR was accepted but reverted the next day because it created other problems for other clients. I felt self-disappointed at that moment. However this thaught me how important it is to be able to test this kind of logic. One of the difficulty at Ayuda was the client specific behaviours that were all around the place. Unfortunately no good solution was implemented at that time.\n\nOn the management side, I felt that the team needed more visibility of the backlog and current tasks status. I submitted the idea of having a board with all that data on the wall (what I saw in my experience at Homerez). I think it facilitated the relationships with the project manager.",

      "excerpt": "I worked at Homerez for 6 months. It was my first professional experience as a web developer.\n\nI learnt how to use AngularJS and NodeJS. That was also the first time I heard about MongoDB and I really enjoyed working with this database.\n\nWe were organized as a scrum team around the CTO (Antoine). As it was my first experience, scrum just felt natural. All the rituals were here for a good reason.\n\nI met great engineers: Tim, Tola and Zihoui! They had taught me pretty much everything I knew by the end of this internship.\n\nWe were developing different web apps to help homeowners rent their place on platforms such as Booking.com and Airbnb. We were in charge of syncing availabilities accross all platforms to maximize the occupation ratio. A big part of the job was to build tools that would help the operational teams: understanding their issues and help fix them. There was no product oriented people at the time in the team so we could get lost in translation sometimes. A perfect place to learn.",
